### Title:
**Custom CNN-Based Plant Disease Detection: A Lightweight and Accurate Deep Learning Solution**

### Abstract:
Plant disease identification is a critical challenge in agriculture, especially in developing regions where expert diagnosis is not always accessible. In this study, we propose a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model tailored specifically for plant disease classification using leaf images.

The model was trained on a large, augmented dataset containing **over 70,000 images across 38 classes**, representing various diseases and healthy states. All images were resized to 128x128 and normalized. Our architecture features residual blocks, batch normalization, and adaptive average pooling for improved learning stability. The model was trained using **Adam optimizer**, **OneCycleLR scheduling**, and **cross-entropy loss** over **5 epochs** on a **GPU-enabled environment (Google Colab)**.

Experimental results show that the model reached a peak validation accuracy of **98.96%**, with validation loss converging steadily. The model also demonstrated strong generalization on an unseen test set. Our results suggest that a custom CNN can be as effective as larger transfer learning models while being computationally more efficient and interpretable.

This work provides a reproducible and practical solution that can be further optimized for real-time mobile deployment in smart agriculture systems.

##  2. Introduction

### Problem Definition:
Diseases in crops can cause massive economic and food production losses if not identified early. Manual diagnosis requires trained experts, which is impractical for large farms or rural areas. The goal from a machine learning standpoint is to build an image-based classification model that can distinguish between dozens of leaf conditions—including subtle differences between similar diseases—reliably and automatically.

### Motivation:
Automating plant disease detection using deep learning models allows scalable, fast, and accurate intervention. With high-resolution cameras available on mobile devices, farmers can potentially diagnose plant diseases in real-time. Such tools can reduce pesticide misuse and improve crop yield. A lightweight custom CNN also opens the door for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### Gap in Literature:
Previous studies often relied on pre-trained transfer learning models (e.g., ResNet, Inception), which, while accurate, are resource-intensive and hard to interpret or adapt. Additionally, many works used smaller datasets or lacked robust evaluation across diverse diseases.

### Contributions:
- Development of a **custom CNN model** designed for 38 plant disease classes.
- Training on a **large augmented dataset** with minimal preprocessing.
- Use of **OneCycle learning rate policy** and **Adam optimizer** for fast convergence.
- High accuracy of **98.96%** within only 5 epochs.
- Demonstrated **generalization** to new images from a held-out test set.

[1] Mohanty et al. (2016) used CNNs on the PlantVillage dataset, achieving high accuracy in lab conditions, but struggled in real-world environments.

[2] Ferentinos (2018) explored deeper CNNs and emphasized diverse datasets but relied heavily on computationally expensive architectures like AlexNet.

[3] Too et al. (2019) compared fine-tuned models (ResNet, DenseNet, etc.) with good results but also high hardware requirements.

In contrast, our approach:
- Uses a **custom-built CNN** optimized for plant leaf imagery.
- Avoids dependence on large pretrained models.
- Demonstrates high accuracy while remaining lightweight and interpretable.
